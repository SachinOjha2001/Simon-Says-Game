Simon Says Game
A simple, interactive memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to follow the pattern shown by the system and repeat it correctly. Every level adds a new color to the sequence — can you keep up?

How to Play
- Press any key to start the game.
- The system will flash a sequence of colored buttons.
- Your task is to remember the sequence and click the buttons in the correct order.
- Each successful level adds one new color to the sequence.
